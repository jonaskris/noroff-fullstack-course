## Course information
***
The Noroff Fullstack Java course is an intensive fullstack course over a 3 month period: 

1. The first month covers frontend development in JavaScript, where the students gain practical experience working with Node.js, Vue.js, React, AngularJS, API's, and web security.
2. The second month introduces backend development in Java, and covers technology like JDBC, REST, Spring, databases, Thymeleaf, Docker, Hibernate, JWT and authentication.
3. The third month is used to develop a fully functional product, where students work in groups to develop a web page from a requirements document.
   
The course assignments consist of daily kata's and weekly group assignments.
1. Daily kata's are small assignments meant to be solved in roughly 1 hour, and yield consistent practice in problem-solving.
2. Weekly group assignments provide practical experience with working in groups. The weekly group assignments are developed using the technologies covered in lectures that week.

In addition, the course provides the [AZ-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900) certification.
