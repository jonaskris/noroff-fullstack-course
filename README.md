## Usage
Most assignments can be viewed on GitHub Pages through links in [Assignments](#assignments) list.
Group assignments not developed in this repository additionally include a link to the project repository.

Kata's are organized based on language used. 
Javascript kata's can be run with the Visual Studio Code extension "Live Server", or whichever alternative extension preferred.
Java kata's can be run using IntelliJ Idea, or whichever IDE/extension preferred.

## Course information
The Noroff Fullstack Java course is an intensive fullstack course over a 3 month period: 

1. The first month covers frontend development in JavaScript, where the students gain practical experience working with Node.js, Vue.js, React, AngularJS, API's, and web security.
2. The second month introduces backend development in Java, and covers technology like JDBC, REST, Spring, databases, Thymeleaf, Docker, Hibernate, JWT and authentication.
3. The third month is used to develop a fully functional product, where students work in groups to develop a web page from a requirements document.
   
The course assignments consist of daily kata's and weekly group assignments.
1. Daily kata's are small assignments meant to be solved in roughly 1 hour, and yield consistent practice in problem-solving.
2. Weekly group assignments provide practical experience with working in groups. The weekly group assignments are developed using the technologies covered in lectures that week.

In addition, the course provides the [AZ-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900) certification.
